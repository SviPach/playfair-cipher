# Playfair Cipher

## Description

The **Playfair Cipher** is a manual symmetric encryption technique and was the first literal digraph substitution cipher. The technique encrypts pairs of letters (digraphs), instead of single letters as in the simple substitution cipher and rather more complex Vigen√®re cipher systems then in use.

## Features

- Encrypts and decrypts messages using a 5x5 matrix.
- Handles both uppercase and lowercase letters.
- Ignores non-alphabetic characters (spaces, punctuation).
- Allows for custom keyword input to generate the cipher matrix.
